About project:

A sorting Algorithm is used to rearrange a given array or list of elements in ascending or descending order using some comparison operator in their algorithm. There are various types of sorting algorithms that uses different approaches to sort a given sequence of numbers. The sorting algorithm takes a list of elements or array as input and performs various operations on the given list of elements and produces the output as a sorted array. There are various factors that needs to be considered while choosing the sorting algorithm.
Following is the list of sorting techniques that we have implemented:
1.	Insertion sort
2.	Merge sort
3.	Heap sort [vector based, and insert one item at a time]
4.	In-place quicksort (any random item or the first or the last item of your input can be pivot).
5.	Modified quicksort
	o	Use median-of-three as pivot.
	o	For small sub-problem of size â‰¤ 10, use insertion sort.


This file provides steps to execute the sorting algorithms:

Default input arrays of sizes : [1000,2000,3000,4000,5000,10000,20000,30000,40000,50000]


To execute Random Array sort run file "randomArray.py"
To execute Sorted Array sort run file "sortedArray.py"
To execute Reverse Array sort run file "reverseArray.py"

Output: Execution Time in milliseconds for each size of array seperated by comma(,) and plotted graph between milliseconds and input size.
